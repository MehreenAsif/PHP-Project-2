# PHP-Project-2: Virtual Slot Machine


Created a PHP program to display a web page for a simple slot machine. The user fills in their name, selects how much they want to bet (from 1 up to however much credit they have) and presses the “spin” button. This triggers a reload of the page. If the user has filled in their name and a bet, the page will be presented again with randomly selected fruit in the boxes and with the name of the user filled in. If they won something (for example, two or three of the fruit match) it will display a win message to let them know, and their credit will be updated accordingly. If they lost, the amount of their bet will be deducted from their credit.

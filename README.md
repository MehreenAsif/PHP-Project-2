# PHP-Project-2
Virtual Slot Machine - Created a PHP program to display a web page for a simple slot machine. The user fills in their name, selects how much they want to bet (from 1 up to however much credit they have) and presses the “spin” buLon. This triggers a reload of the page. If the user has filled in their name and a bet, the page should be presented again with randomly selected fruit in the boxes and with the name of the user filled in. If they won something (for example, two or three of the fruit match) you should display a win message somewhere on the page to let them know, and their credit should be updated accordingly. If they lost, you should deduct the amount of their bet from their credit.
